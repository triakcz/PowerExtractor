PowerExtractor
==============

GPL MPPT Regulator for bike (development prototype)

This is not finished project in development. Using Arduino to maximize power extracted from dynamo hub or solar panels ... yes it is so universal. Prototype tests shown power output of 8Watts @ 40km/h. Conversion efficiency is about 90% measured after initial rectification).
